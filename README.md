# OAuth Provider with Spring Security OAuth
This project provides an OAuth 1.0a endpoint, and was developed as a study case of a single-sign-on server using the OAuth protocol. It can be used as the main user provider for applications with a common users database. The project uses a MySQL database, Spring Framework components, HTML5 and CSS3.

## Configuration

## Usage

## Improvements
As the provider is very simple, there are lots of improvementes that should be made in order to use it as a real SSO server. The following list could be some of them:

* Save the tokens generated by the Spring Security OAuth in a database, this can be made through an implementation of the OAuthProviderTokenServices;
* After having the tokens stored in the database, implement a consumers service, allowing the administrator to have more control on which applications can access and ask for authorization in the OAuth provider. To make this, a service that implements the ConsumerDetailsService should be created;
* When the provider has stored in a database the consumers and the tokens, then the application can list to the users which applications they authorized, allowing him to also revoke the applications access;
* One major improvement is to reimplement the provider using the OAuth 2.0 specification, as soon as it becomes stable, by the date this provider was developed the specs were only in draft.

## Monograph
The full monograph document can be found in my [blog](http://fernandomantoan.com/monografia-2/estudo-de-caso-de-uma-estrutura-de-autenticacao-unica-utilizando-o-protocolo-oauth/) and it's written in Brazilian Portuguese. To make the study case, two consumers were created:

* A [bills management system](https://github.com/fernandomantoan/oauth-consumer-sample-zf), which uses [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com) and Zend_Oauth_Consumer component;
* A [contacts management system](https://github.com/fernandomantoan/oauth-consumer-sample-play), which uses [Play! Framework](http://www.playframework.org) and the OAuth module.
